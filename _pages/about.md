Hello internet, I'm a first generation Iranian-American who was lucky enough to make it to America. I'm currently a mechanical engineer at Boston Scientific in Minnesota working on developing new and innovative products that will change patient care for the better. Simultaneousely, I'm working on adding to my knowledge of computing and robotics by taking online courses and doing projects on my own; you can check them out here on my "Project" page. Below you will find a summary of what I've done in the past, both professionally and academically.

You can tell from the photos on my website that I like travel a lot and more importantly experience a lot. I'm a passionate person no matter what I do, and I get along with people very well. If you're interested in getting to know me, please reach out, I'd be happy to introduce myself further!
